# Clohessy-Wiltshire
Python program for solving the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations and plotting a 3D animation of the solution for a given starting position/ velocity vector and mean motion of the primary orbiting body. The Clohessy-Wiltshire equations describe a simplified model of orbital relative motion, in which the target is in a circular orbit, and the chaser spacecraft is in an elliptical or circular orbit. This model gives a first-order approximation of the chaser's motion in a target-centered coordinate system. It is very useful in planning rendezvous of the chaser with the target
